// Notes
- The Electron app will be the main application that runs on the user's computer
- The Vue frontend will be the user interface for the Electron app
- The Electron app will communicate with the Vue frontend using IPC

Stats: color chart or just a bar with percentages for, label colors, show (functional, faulty, unresponsible)

Search: input with search, dynamically show as you search, buttons for stats or control of selected robot

Control: (move to More) // NB: not in the sidebar but displays in sidebar contents; control given robot

Reports: show reports e.g summary overview for whats needed (number of lamps, controller reconections, ), for overides with timestamps and reasons

Alerts: show notifications for faults (robot pos, and problem) with a brief description if neccessary, import to a csv file

More: robot control section (ontop), manage robots (add/remove robots from the database),

Settings: (move to More) toggle: (power saving mode i.e if no traffic detected, smooth traffic i.e green for traffic if no car in another direction, decongestion mode, dark mode)

Account: show user (name, ), if main user can add/remove another user, about

Map: show map, add markers for robots, show when hoved, click for more (open search with robot), zoom in/out with focus on CBD, (small transparent div at the bottom for display actions to do, whats being done)

// Edge cases:
-

// Rem:
- To buid the Vue frontend, run `npm run build` in the `view` directory when ready to package the Electron app
- Uninstall leaflet-mbtiles

// Tasks:
- Complete overview, search, (almost done)
- Do transitions for contents page (someday)
- Connection button

// Ideas:
- MapDiv to emit to MainPage onclick on robots (this emit to change components on MainPage#side-bar)
- Add control svg to RobotsList <li> tags (onclick to open control sidebar), onclick on <li> to show robot on map
- SideBar - control a single robot at a time, click on robot on map show label with the control svg

// Tommorow:
- Do searching on search, filtering on overview, Map and the robots database
