// App
- npm run dev (in the app directory) // to run the Electron app
- npx tailwindcss -i ./src/assets/css/styles.css -o ./src/assets/css/tailwind.css --watch (in the view directory) // to run tailwindcss
- npx electron sqlite.js // to run the Electron app with SQLite (for sqlite.js and seeder.js)

// Notes
- The Electron app will be the main application that runs on the user's computer
- The Vue frontend will be the user interface for the Electron app
- The Electron app will communicate with the Vue frontend using IPC

Stats: color chart or just a bar with percentages for, label colors, show (functional, faulty, unresponsible)

Search: input with search, dynamically show as you search, buttons for stats or control of selected robot

Control: (move to More) // NB: not in the sidebar but displays in sidebar contents; control given robot

Reports: show reports e.g summary overview for whats needed (number of lamps, controller reconections, ), for overides with timestamps and reasons

Alerts: show notifications for faults (robot pos, and problem) with a brief description if neccessary, import to a csv file

More: robot control section (ontop), manage robots (add/remove robots from the database),

Settings: (move to More) toggle: (power saving mode i.e if no traffic detected, smooth traffic i.e green for traffic if no car in another direction, decongestion mode, dark mode)

Account: show user (name, ), if main user can add/remove another user, about

Map: show map, add markers for robots, show when hoved, click for more (open search with robot), zoom in/out with focus on CBD, (small transparent div at the bottom for display actions to do, whats being done)

// Edge cases:
-

// Rem:
- To buid the Vue frontend, run `npm run build` in the `view` directory when ready to package the Electron app
- Uninstall leaflet-mbtiles

// Ideas:
- Use Pinia for state management to handle the robot data and interactions between components (in case the app grows larger) (robot data left for now)
- Show severity levels (e.g., critical faults in red, minor ones in orange) - Provide expand/collapse functionality for detailed fault descriptions.

// Errors:
- Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading '_latLngToNewLayerPoint')
            TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '_latLngToNewLayerPoint')

- Error: npm audit (in the view directory)
            run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details

// Tasks:
- Do transitions for contents page (someday)
- Connection button
- add these colors: text-green-500 
- do the control section, make it an overlay that opens when a robot is clicked on the map or somewhere else
- change from emits to Pinia for interactivity between components (MainPage, MapDiv, SideBar)

// Onresume:
- Detection Strategy (Per Node)
    Capture image periodically (e.g. every 2 seconds).
    Run TinyML on esp32 model to classify:
    No vehicle
    Normal vehicle
    Emergency vehicle
    If status changes, send alert via ESP-NOW:
    { "node_id": 3, "type": "emergency_vehicle" }
